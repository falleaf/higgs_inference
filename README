# Inference experiments on a Higgs EFT data set

Johann Brehmer, Kyle Cranmer, Gilles Louppe, and Juan Pavez

## Folder structure

- `data`: The data set, including both the original weighted event sample as well as the unweighted training, calibration, and evaluation samples. Some of these are quite large and not on GitHub.
- `evaluation`: IPython notebooks that extract metrics and figures from the experiments.
- `figures`: Here the figures are stored.
- `inference`: The main folder for the inference experiments. `experiments.py` starts the different training and evaluation runs.
- `notes`: LaTeX notes roughly summarising the state of the experiments.
- `preprocessing`: Unweighting routines that generate the different training, calibration, and evaluation samples from the original weighted event file.
- `prototypes`: Toy experiments and cross-checks on other data. Includes the `flow` folder with a PyTorch implementation of normalizing flows.
- `results`: The predictions of the different algorithms on the test data set.
